-- Decision analytics over the long-format observation table.
--   observations(series_id, entity_id, observed_at, captured_at, metric,
--                value, unit, source_id, raw_ref, parser_version)
-- Run with: python examples/load_observations.py
-- Or in DuckDB, straight off GitHub with no credentials:
--   SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/q3dresearch/wss-openrouter/main/derived/observations/*.csv')

-- EVERY query starts by deduplicating. Several sources restate the same
-- observed_at on each capture -- the task mix describes a trailing 7-day
-- window, so three captures produce three rows for the same week. That is
-- deliberate (it is how a revision becomes visible) but it means a naive
-- filter returns duplicates. `latest` keeps the most recent statement of
-- each fact, which is what almost every question wants.

-- Cost versus capability: what a point of intelligence costs, per model.
-- Which model to default to, and which "premium" model buys you nothing.
